**The Text Summarization Tool is a Python-based solution that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate concise summaries of lengthy articles. It leverages the sumy libraryâ€™s Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) summarizer to extract key sentences that retain the core meaning of the original text. The script processes an input article, tokenizes it, and selects the most relevant sentences based on semantic relationships. Users can specify the number of sentences in the summary. This tool is ideal for quickly extracting important information from long documents, making it useful for research, news aggregation, and content summarization.**
